# App-Development
The projects in this repository are related to Android and IOS app development. The main project I am working on is "ZZusRide," an transportation app based on an idea I came up with during the 5th Annual Crimson Code Hackathon.
Any other projects that are to be stored in this repo (projects outside of the ZZusRide folder) are merely practice projects to help me learn and understand new APIs and frameworks that I plan to investigate and possibly implement into the ZZus Ride App.
For example: The FireChat application is a project I built while taking a Udacity course which taught me how to use Google's Firebase Database.
